Yt-dlp is likely to be blocked for IP ranges of VPS providers, I tried a few months ago on digital ocean and it didnt work, but you may try others. I just ended up self hosting it on a minipc I have running 24/7 at home with minimum power consumption

Commenting here because I am running into the same exact issue for my new bot.

2024-12-10T04:21:56.168Z: BobbyHertz issued command "!play acdc thunderstruck"
2024-12-10T04:22:00.173Z: Playing song: AC/DC - Thunderstruck (Official Video) - 04:53
2024-12-10T04:22:00.547Z: Finished song queue
It can hit YouTube just fine to search for and queue up the song, but then the song playback immediately ends.

I resolved my ffmpeg issues by using the ffmpeg-static package and passing in the ffmpegPath, requiring no installation beyond npm install. However, I suspect that there is still an ffmpeg issue that is just occurring silently.

I also tried exposing a TCP port, but I don't think that is necessary for a Discord music bot, nor did I see any changed behavior by doing that.

Here is the Dockerfile I am using as a reference. I had to start with a non-alpine version of Node.js, otherwise I was getting catastrophic FFMPEG errors. With the version in this file, I get no error, but no music plays for me either.

# Use a Node.js base image
FROM node:22

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /harmonibot

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json into the container
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application files into the container
COPY . .

# Define the default command to run your app
CMD ["node", "index.js"]
I'm going to keep digging into this and will reply back if I find anything. Keep me posted if you manage to find anything as well!

UPDATE:

Use node:22-bullseye as your base image (so your first line of your Dockerfile would be FROM node:22-bullseye). That's the latest base image I've found so far that gets ffmpeg working (and actually playing) with the ffmpeg-static library.

Let me know if this helps!

I did not know about this one. Thanks for your comment. I would definitely look into it. I did the both with python and now I have it constantly running in a old desktop i had. It’s been working successfully for the past 24 hours!!!
