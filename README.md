2. Create a new Web Service on Render:
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Choose "Docker" as the environment

## Important Notes

- The bot includes a keep-alive Flask server that prevents it from sleeping on free tier hosting
- Environment variables must be properly set for the bot to function
- For Text-to-Speech functionality, the bot requires the following Discord permissions:
  - Connect to voice channels
  - Speak in voice channels
  - Send messages and embeds
  - Add reactions
- Auto-TTS can be toggled on/off for specific channels using the `g!autotts` command
- The bot automatically disconnects from voice channels after 2 minutes of inactivity
- To avoid spam, TTS messages are limited to 200 characters
- The bot can read messages in multiple languages (Tagalog, English, Chinese, Japanese, Korean)
- The PostgreSQL database stores audio data for the replay function, conversation history, and economy data

### Nickname Formatting System

The bot includes an automatic nickname formatting system that:
- Converts members' names to a bold Unicode font format
- Adds role-specific emojis to nicknames based on the member's highest role
- Automatically updates nicknames when roles change
- Continuously scans and updates all nicknames every 10 seconds
- Handles special permissions for server owners and high-role users
- Can be enabled server-wide with the `g!setupnn` command (admin only)
